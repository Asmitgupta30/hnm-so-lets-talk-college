College what?

the repository mostly made in the nights (ackwnoledging my fked up sleep schedule) a few ambitious projects, and slightly more legible handwriting (progress, right?).

After years of navigating coursework, labs, and just a few existential crises, I’ve decided it’s time to organize the chaos. This repository is a collection of everything I’ve worked on during my college years—projects, notes, ideas, and the occasional "what was I thinking?" moment.

Why Am I Doing This?

Great question. Here’s the logic I’ve convinced myself with:

Nostalgia: Because nothing says "fond memories" like reliving problem sets and project deadlines.

Growth Check: To remind myself that, while I’ve struggled through some tough stuff, I’ve come out stronger (and slightly more caffeinated).
Because I Should: Let’s face it—if I don’t organize this now, future me won’t stand a chance.
What You’ll Find Here

Projects: From galaxy bias to sedimentology—some groundbreaking, some just barely standing ground.

Notes: Equal parts insightful, chaotic, and doodle-filled.

Books & Resources: The academic lifelines that kept me afloat (and maybe a few I skimmed last minute).

Random Artifacts: Ideas, drafts, and the occasional "this seemed like a good idea at the time."

ah well

Make Sense of It All Turn my mountain of work into something organized and useful.
Create Something Worth Sharing: Maybe this chaos will inspire someone or at least give them a laugh.
This is an ongoing project, so join me as I untangle the web of my college life. Who knows? You might just find a gem hidden in here.
